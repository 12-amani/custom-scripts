# Vegetation Condition Index script

<a href="https://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i-single.php?id=249">VCI</a> is a multi-temporal index comparing NDVI in a selected dekad (10-day period) to minimum and maximum values from reference years.

Because of multi-temporality, works only in the experimental <a href="https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-playground-temporal">temporal version</a> of Sentinel hub playground. Be sure to enable temporal data in the effects tab.

Observed and reference periods are currently hard-coded in the script. They could instead be taken as, respectively, last 10 days of selected time interval and the 10-day period in all previous years within the time interval.
