# Collection of custom scripts

 - [Cohen-Braaten-Yang cloud detection](cby_cloud_detection)
 - [Hollstein Clouds, Cirrus, Snow, Shadow, Water and Clear Sky Pixels detection](hollstein)
 
 ## Adding new custom scripts

 Create a new directory entry for your custom script, say `my_algorithm`. The Javascript code goes into `my_algorithm/script.js` and there should be `my_algorithm/README.md` accompanying the script. Please follow the conventions in [this example of a README](cby_cloud_detection/README.md).
  
  Once you have set up the directory structure please add an entry pointing to your script to the above bullet list.
